* Worked with a starter code to add the functionality to the save buttons to be able to save the text input to the local storage as well as for the input to be displayed upon the page reload.

* Added the Current Day and Time to be displayed at the top of the page;

* Used daysJS to compare the current hour against the past/future/present classes/hours to apply the correspomding color;

* Day JS resources used:
